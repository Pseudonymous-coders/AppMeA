Sleep Investigator
=====
A tool for quantifying 1/3 of your life.

## What is does

### Sleep apnea information
Identifying sleep information, aiding in giving you an idea if you have sleep apnea

### Restlessness tracking
Tracking how much tossing and turning the user is doing

### Alert if breathing stops
If enabled, whenever the user stops breathing, an alarm (an illumi bulb) will flash
and an SMS will be sent to someone who can revive the user.

## How it works

### Leveraging AT&Ts M2X time series data storage
Most of our lives can be quantified in one way or another, but sleep is one facet of
our life that is typically left out of consideration. Some people track how much they
sleep, yes, but how many people keep detailed, unique, and insightful statistics on
every night they sleep? Not a lot. This is our solution to that. By using three
sensors, visual movement, movement of bed, and breath counting, all publishing
themselves to their own M2X stream, we can pull that data and analyze it in
meaningful ways to the user. 

## Required hardware

### Kinect
A kinect is used to track body movements  

### Accelerometer
Pick up bed movements from the user moving around

### Microphone
Pick up breath count
